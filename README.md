# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets\

Time spent: 6 Hours in Total 

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.\

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL

## Notes

Not sure how to do the CSRF one. I am unfamiliar with how to create a form and upload it to a website. I know how to mess around with a form on a website, but not how to upload my own to the site. I was messing around with some options for a while, but I couldn't figure it out.
